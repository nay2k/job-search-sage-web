# Shared Infrastructure - Requirements

## Feature Overview

The Shared Infrastructure provides the foundational systems that all features depend on, including user authentication, project setup, basic UI framework, and backend integration. This infrastructure must be implemented first to support feature development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1.1 - User Authentication System

**User Story:** As a new job seeker, I want to create an account and log in securely, so that I can access my personalized job search data across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide email/password signup with Supabase authentication
2. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure user session and redirect to onboarding
3. IF a user is returning THEN the system SHALL authenticate them securely and restore their session
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing security details

### Requirement 1.2 - User Onboarding Flow

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to complete a guided onboarding process, so that I can set up my profile and job search preferences efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an onboarding wizard
2. WHEN a user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL collect their base resume, job search goals, and preferences
3. WHEN a user uploads their resume THEN the system SHALL store it securely and validate the file format (PDF/Word)
4. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect users to the main dashboard

### Requirement 1.3 - User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to manage my profile and preferences, so that I can keep my information current and customize my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses profile settings THEN the system SHALL allow editing of personal information, goals, and preferences
2. WHEN profile changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate and save updates securely
3. WHEN users update preferences THEN the system SHALL apply changes across all features immediately
4. WHEN users want to delete their account THEN the system SHALL provide secure account deletion with data cleanup

### Requirement 6.1 - Project Configuration and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured development environment, so that I can build features efficiently with all necessary tools and libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL have all required dependencies installed (Tailwind CSS, Pinia, OpenAI SDK)
2. WHEN configuring the project THEN the system SHALL have proper TypeScript configuration and build tools
3. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL have secure configuration for API keys and secrets
4. WHEN development starts THEN the system SHALL have hot reload and development tools configured

### Requirement 6.2 - Basic UI Framework and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation and responsive design, so that I can easily access all features across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users navigate the app THEN the system SHALL provide consistent navigation and layout components
2. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN the system SHALL display responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
3. WHEN accessing features THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation between different sections
4. WHEN loading content THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states and error boundaries

### Requirement 6.3 - Database Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be stored securely and persistently, so that I can access my job search information reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is saved THEN the system SHALL store it securely in Supabase PostgreSQL with proper encryption
2. WHEN users access data THEN the system SHALL implement row-level security to protect user privacy
3. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions where appropriate
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error recovery

### Requirement 6.4 - Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable application performance with clear error messages, so that I can complete my tasks even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and fallback options
3. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL log them for monitoring while protecting user privacy
4. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and offline capabilities where possible
