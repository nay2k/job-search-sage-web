1. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators with context
2. WHEN operations take time THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated completion times
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery options
4. WHEN network issues happen THEN the system SHALL provide offline indicators and retry mechanisms

### Requirement UI.5 - Responsive Design and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work well on all devices and be accessible to users with disabilities, so that everyone can use the job search platform effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
