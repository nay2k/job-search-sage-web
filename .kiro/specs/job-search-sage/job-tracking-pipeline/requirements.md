# Job Tracking Pipeline - Requirements

## Feature Overview

The Job Tracking Pipeline feature provides a visual, systematic approach to managing job applications through a Kanban-style interface. Users can track jobs through various stages, monitor metrics, set follow-up reminders, and maintain detailed notes and communication history for each application.

3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL provide context about what type of follow-up is appropriate
4. WHEN users respond to reminders THEN the system SHALL update the job status and reset timing

### Requirement 3.5 - Timeline Visualization

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to see a timeline of my job search activity, so that I can understand my application patterns and maintain consistent activity levels.

4. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display chronological timeline of all job-related activities

### Requirement 3.7 - Job Outcome Tracking

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to track final outcomes for completed applications, so that I can learn from both successes and rejections to improve future applications.
