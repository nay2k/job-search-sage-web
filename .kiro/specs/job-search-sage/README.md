# JobSearchSage - Feature-Based Specification

## Overview

JobSearchSage is an AI-powered systematic job search platform that transforms chaotic job searching into a data-driven, methodical process. The MVP is organized into four core features, each with dedicated requirements and implementation tasks.

## Feature Structure

- **Requirements**: Job posting analysis, AI tailoring, document comparison, ATS scoring
- **Key Components**: ResumeUploader, DocumentComparison, ATSAnalyzer
- **API Endpoints**: `/server/api/ai/tailor-resume`, `/server/api/ai/generate-cover-letter`

### 💬 [AI Chat](./ai-chat/)

Intelligent coaching assistant with personalized job search guidance

- **Requirements**: Conversational interface, methodology-based advice, performance analysis
- **Key Components**: ChatInterface, conversation management, context awareness

### 📊 [Job Tracking Pipeline](./job-tracking-pipeline/)

Visual Kanban-style job application management with metrics and analytics

- **Requirements**: Pipeline management, metrics calculation, follow-up reminders, notes tracking
- **Key Components**: PipelineBoard, JobCard, MetricsDashboard, TimelineVisualization
- **API Endpoints**: Job CRUD operations, metrics calculation

### 📧 [Professional Communication](./professional-communication/)

AI-powered communication templates with strategic timing guidance

- **Requirements**: Email generation, thank you notes, salary negotiation, LinkedIn outreach
- **Key Components**: TemplateLibrary, MessageComposer, CommunicationScheduler
- **API Endpoints**: Communication generation, template management

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. **Shared Infrastructure**: Complete backend setup, authentication, and database integration
2. **Shared UI**: Build layout system, design components, and frontend state management
3. Create mock data stores and basic navigation for feature development

### Phase 2: Feature Development (can be done in parallel)

1. **Document Generation**: Start with resume upload and basic AI integration
2. **Job Pipeline**: Build Kanban interface and basic job management
3. **AI Chat**: Create chat interface and basic AI responses
4. **Communication**: Build template library and basic message generation

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish

1. Connect features with shared data and context
2. Implement real-time updates and notifications
3. Add comprehensive error handling and UX polish
4. Migrate from mock data to Supabase backend

### Phase 4: Production Ready

1. Add security, monitoring, and performance optimization
2. Implement deployment pipeline
3. Add comprehensive testing and documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a Feature**: Select one of the four feature folders to work on
2. **Review Requirements**: Read the `requirements.md` file for your chosen feature
3. **Check Tasks**: Review the `tasks.md` file for implementation steps
4. **Start Development**: Begin with the first task in your chosen feature

## Cross-Feature Dependencies

- **AI Chat** can reference data from **Job Pipeline** for personalized advice
- **Professional Communication** integrates with **Job Pipeline** for context
- **Document Generation** can be triggered from **Job Pipeline** job entries
- All features share user authentication and profile data

This structure allows for:

- **Focused Development**: Work on one feature at a time
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different features
- **Clear Ownership**: Each feature has dedicated requirements and tasks
- **Manageable Scope**: Smaller, more digestible chunks of work
- **Independent Testing**: Features can be tested and deployed independently
